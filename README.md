# Church Bulletin Autofill - Google Sheets Extension

This code was created using Google Apps Script (GAS) for the `ChurchBulletinSchedule` Google Sheet. 
It extracts data from the Google Sheet to autofill a Google Doc template of the bulletin for that week.

The `src` folder contains the script for the `Bulletin Autofill Template` GAS.
The `docs_to_pdf` folder contains copied code from `Docs to PDF` GAS. The Google Docs templates aren't using them as of Dec. 17, 2024.
